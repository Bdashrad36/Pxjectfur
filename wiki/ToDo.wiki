I am liking this WASC criteria x-ref as a guide for patterns to explore and develop
http://projects.webappsec.org/Threat-Classification-Taxonomy-Cross-Reference-View

*Format String Attack* - Would like another set of eyes that know format string attacks better than I do to review and validate these patterns, even though they are derived from other attack tools

*LDAP Injection* - more patterns

*OS Command Injection* - more patterns, especially for windows

*SQL Injection* - more platform specific stuff

*SSI Injection* - i suspect there are more patterns out there
 
*XPath Injection* - pretty sure there are more encodings and patterns out there

*HTTP Header Injection / Response Splitting* - pretty sure there are more encodings and patterns out there

*Local File Includes* - need patterns

*lists of backdoors*  - needs more backdoor names

*Potential Malicious File Uploads* - pretty sure there are more encodings and patterns out there, esp. more platform specific stuff 

*usernames and passwords* - some files need to be split and cleaned up

*discovery* - need more pattern files for popular apps

*backdoors* - more needed
